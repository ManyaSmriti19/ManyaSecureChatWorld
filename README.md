We have made a secure data exchange app where files are
encrypted using RSA-CRT algorithm and hashed later. On successful
implementation of our project, we observed that the proposed technique is
more secure as compared to original RSA algorithm and RSA-CRT. And it
enhanced the algorithm performance for decryption because it employed the
CRT for decryption, thus the proposed technique proved to be faster than RSA
with multi keys.
